# Colour Palette Maker

This project comes from Colt Steele's ["The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) course on Udemy and is based on a combination of many websites including [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material UI Colors](https://materialuicolors.co/).

I have re-coded the entire project to use React Hooks instead of vanilla React.js.
